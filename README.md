# Simple Calculator

A basic calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This calculator performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers.

## Features

- **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division**: Perform basic arithmetic operations.
- **Dynamic Display**: Shows the entered numbers and operators in real time.
- **Reset Function**: Clears all entered values and resets the calculator.

## Limitations

- **Two-Number Operations**: This calculator can only handle operations with two numbers at a time. To perform additional calculations, you need to clear the current result or start over with a new calculation.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Clone or Download** the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Use the calculator buttons to perform basic arithmetic operations.

## How It Works

- **HTML**: Creates the calculator layout with buttons and a display screen.
- **CSS**: Styles the calculator interface.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for arithmetic operations and updating the display.

## Future Improvements

To extend functionality, consider:
- Supporting operations with multiple sequential numbers.
- Adding a decimal point functionality for non-integer calculations.
- Displaying a history of calculations.
